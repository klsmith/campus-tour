# campus-tour

CampusMap in assets folder is for HamiltonCycle.
CampusFullDistance in asset folder is for TSPNearestNeighbour.
HamiltonCycle and TSPNearestNeighbour need to be run separately. The nodes is 24, then copy the matrix in CampusMap to HamiltonCycle to get the loop path. For TSPNearestNeighbour, nodes is also 24, then copy the matrix in CampusFullDistance to TSPNearestNeighbour to get the one-waypath.
